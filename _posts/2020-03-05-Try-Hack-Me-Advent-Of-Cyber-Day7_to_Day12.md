So this is the continuation to the Advent_of_Cyber 25 part Series on <https://tryhackme.com>

## Day7(Task 12)
here we have to do a nmap scan on the given ip and answer some question based on the scan results **So_Ezzzz**

I used the following command
```bash
nmap -v -sT -A  10.10.231.143
```
some part of the log results are given below 

![](img/thm_advent/27.png)


we see a http server on port **999**
we access it on our browser to get the answer to the last question

## Day8(Task 13)
So I have to find the port on which ssh is running on so I use the following command

```bash
nmap -v -p- --min-parallelism 100  10.10.159.75
```
we get the port 65534 open and further scan reveals that it is running ssh

![](img/thm_advent/29.png)

lets ssh into it 
we now use the following command to find **SUID** file with user root as the name of the challenge suggest 
we use the command

```bash
find / -user root -perm -4000 -print 2>/dev/null
```

now the system-control binary looks interesting,on checking it out we find that it executes any command we supply as root so we can get both the flags using this binary

## Day9(Task 14)
This is a simple scripting task we just have to write a script to find the **value** by using *requests* and *json* module in python

```python
import requests
import json

path="f"
host="http://10.10.241.214:3000/"
value=""

while 1==1:
	response=requests.get(host+path)
	# print(response.text)
	json_data=json.loads(response.text)
	path=json_data["next"]
	if path=="end":
		break
	value=value+json_data["value"]
	# print(value)

print(value)
```
On running the script we get the flag

## Day10(Task 15)

So this is basically intro to the metasploit framework

lets start by basic nmap scans

![](img/thm_advent/36.png)

now running nikto to find the vulnerablity in the web server

![](img/thm_advent/40.png)

so we got a strut vulnerablity from nikto lets search for it in msfconsole

![](img/thm_advent/37.png)

configuring the exploit in the msfconsole and running it

![](img/thm_advent/35.png)

now finding the flag using basic regex

![](img/thm_advent/33.png)

and ssh pass from bash_history 

![](img/thm_advent/34.png)

now logging into ssh using the credentials and finding the asked info

![](img/thm_advent/38.png)

![](img/thm_advent/39.png)


## Day11(Task 16)
This Challenge introduces us to the basic file transfer and database service
First of lets nmap scan the ip 

![](img/thm_advent/42.png)

### Task 1
Here we have to read creds.txt from nfs of the server

![](img/thm_advent/41.png)

### Task 2 
Here we login using creds as **anonymous:anonymous**
and get the desired file

![](img/thm_advent/43.png)

![](img/thm_advent/44.png)

### Task 3
Now login in to mysql database using the credentials found and look for useful data

![](img/thm_advent/45.png)

The task is Done *:)))*

## Day12(Task 17)

So in this challenge we are given a zip file, on unzipping it we find the following

![](img/thm_advent/49.png)



### ques 1
we need to find the md5sum of note1 file which can be done easily in the terminal :smile:

![](img/thm_advent/46.png)

### ques 2
we need to decrypt the gpg file and we are given the passphrase as **25daysofchristmas**

![](img/thm_advent/47.png)

### ques 3 
we need to decrypt an encrypted text file using the given private rsa key 
here google comes to my rescue we need to use *openssl rsautl*
